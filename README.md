Are you a hungry/undercaffeinated vegan in Berlin? Use this app, with my personal recommendations, to find something nearby that satisfies your cravings!

I made this to practise coding in TypeScript and using React context — yes, a little overengineered, but it served a purpose.

For the dropdowns I used the [Material UI Select components](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-select/) — unfortunately, due to a known issue ([1](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/34414), [2](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/33399 ), [3](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/35715)) relating to types and state management, working with these wasn't totally straightforward. But I've found an alternative way to make the app work that I'm happy with for now!
